            <h2>Survive In Life</h2>
            <p>My dream was to become a BCS officer and live my life lavishly. But since i'm a worthless piece of trash that's not realistic anymore. So I decided to suck it up and struggle to survive in life. How's that for dreaming big? Do check out my resume though. It's trash as well. </p>

            <p>  This year I finally gave in and settled for a two-bit job that I know nothing about. I've been struggling to understand what others are even talking about here let alone contributing anything. But hey, what do I care. I just wanna get paid somehow. Also soon i'll be contractually bound to serve for 3 more years in this shithole. Good job, myself. </p>
